- **Conflict Documentation**: Transparent presentation of resolved conflicts

**Output Formats:**
- **Comprehensive**: Full integration with all perspectives and resolutions
- **Comparative**: Side-by-side presentation of different perspectives
- **Synthesis**: Unified framework combining all perspectives
- **Domain-specific**: Tailored formatting for specific research domains

### 4. Workflow Integration
**File:** `backend/workflow/cross_disciplinary_node.py`

- **cross_disciplinary_detector_node**: Detects cross-disciplinary research needs
- **cross_disciplinary_integrator_node**: Performs multi-domain integration
