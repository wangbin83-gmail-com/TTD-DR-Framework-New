# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TTD-DR Framework frontend is currently unable to display properly due to backend connectivity issues and configuration problems. The frontend application loads but cannot connect to the backend API, preventing users from starting research workflows or viewing any content. This feature aims to fix all display and connectivity issues to restore full functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend application to load and display properly, so that I can access the TTD-DR Framework interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the frontend URL THEN the application SHALL load without errors
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the user interface SHALL display all components correctly
3. WHEN the application loads THEN all CSS styles SHALL be applied properly
4. WHEN the application loads THEN no console errors SHALL be present

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the backend API to be accessible from the frontend, so that I can interact with the research workflow system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend server starts THEN it SHALL run without import errors
2. WHEN the frontend makes API requests THEN the backend SHALL respond successfully
3. WHEN the backend starts THEN all required modules SHALL be properly imported
4. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL return appropriate responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the WebSocket connection to work properly, so that I can receive real-time updates during research workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a research workflow starts THEN the WebSocket connection SHALL be established
2. WHEN workflow progress updates occur THEN they SHALL be transmitted via WebSocket
3. WHEN the WebSocket connection fails THEN it SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
4. WHEN WebSocket messages are received THEN they SHALL be processed correctly by the frontend

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to start a research workflow from the frontend, so that I can generate research reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user fills out the research form THEN all form fields SHALL be validated properly
2. WHEN the user submits a research topic THEN the workflow SHALL start successfully
3. WHEN the workflow starts THEN the user SHALL be redirected to the dashboard view
4. WHEN the workflow is running THEN progress updates SHALL be displayed in real-time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the workflow dashboard with real-time progress, so that I can monitor the research process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow is running THEN the dashboard SHALL display current progress
2. WHEN workflow nodes complete THEN their status SHALL update in the visualization
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed with appropriate error messages
4. WHEN the workflow completes THEN the user SHALL be able to view the final report

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and export generated research reports, so that I can use the research results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow completes THEN the final report SHALL be displayed properly
2. WHEN viewing a report THEN all formatting and styling SHALL be correct
3. WHEN the user wants to export THEN multiple format options SHALL be available
4. WHEN exporting a report THEN the file SHALL be generated and downloaded successfully
