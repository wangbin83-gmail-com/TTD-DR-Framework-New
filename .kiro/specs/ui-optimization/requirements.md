# UI Optimization Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing the user interface of the TTD-DR Framework frontend application. The current interface has been reported as "particularly ugly and irregular" with operational errors occurring during user interactions. This optimization will focus on creating a modern, consistent, and user-friendly interface that provides a smooth user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visual Design Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want a visually consistent and modern interface, so that I can navigate and use the application confidently without being distracted by poor design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loads any page THEN the interface SHALL display consistent typography, spacing, and color schemes throughout
2. WHEN the user interacts with buttons and controls THEN they SHALL have consistent styling, hover states, and visual feedback
3. WHEN the user views different components THEN they SHALL follow a unified design system with consistent margins, padding, and border radius
4. WHEN the user switches between different sections THEN the layout SHALL maintain visual hierarchy and consistency

### Requirement 2: Responsive Layout Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to work well on different screen sizes, so that I can use the application effectively regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application on mobile devices THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately without horizontal scrolling
2. WHEN the user resizes the browser window THEN components SHALL reflow and maintain usability
3. WHEN the user views the workflow visualization THEN it SHALL be properly sized and navigable on all screen sizes
4. WHEN the user accesses panels and modals THEN they SHALL be appropriately sized for the viewport

### Requirement 3: Workflow Visualization Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want an improved workflow visualization, so that I can easily understand the process flow and current status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the workflow diagram THEN nodes SHALL be properly aligned and spaced for clarity
2. WHEN the user interacts with workflow nodes THEN they SHALL provide clear visual feedback and status indication
3. WHEN the workflow is running THEN the active states SHALL be clearly visible with appropriate animations
4. WHEN the user clicks on nodes THEN the interaction SHALL be smooth without errors

### Requirement 4: Report Management Interface Polish

**User Story:** As a user, I want a polished report management interface, so that I can efficiently work with research reports without interface issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user switches between tabs THEN the transitions SHALL be smooth and the active state clearly indicated
2. WHEN the user edits content THEN the editor SHALL provide a comfortable writing experience with proper formatting
3. WHEN the user exports reports THEN the process SHALL provide clear feedback and handle errors gracefully
4. WHEN the user manages annotations THEN the interface SHALL be intuitive and responsive

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when operations succeed or fail, so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations are in progress THEN the user SHALL see appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the user SHALL receive clear, actionable error messages
3. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the user SHALL receive confirmation feedback
4. WHEN the user performs invalid actions THEN they SHALL be prevented with helpful guidance

### Requirement 6: Performance and Interaction Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth and responsive interactions, so that I can work efficiently without delays or glitches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks buttons or links THEN the response SHALL be immediate with appropriate visual feedback
2. WHEN the user scrolls through content THEN the scrolling SHALL be smooth without lag
3. WHEN the user loads large reports THEN the interface SHALL remain responsive with progressive loading if needed
4. WHEN the user performs multiple actions quickly THEN the interface SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking

### Requirement 7: Accessibility and Usability

**User Story:** As a user, I want an accessible and intuitive interface, so that I can use the application effectively regardless of my technical expertise or accessibility needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates with keyboard THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible and properly focused
2. WHEN the user uses screen readers THEN the interface SHALL provide appropriate labels and descriptions
3. WHEN the user looks for functionality THEN the interface SHALL use clear, intuitive icons and labels
4. WHEN the user needs help THEN tooltips and contextual information SHALL be available where appropriate
