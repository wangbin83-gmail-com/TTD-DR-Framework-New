# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR) is an innovative deep research agent framework designed to enhance Large Language Models' (LLMs) capability to generate complex, comprehensive research reports. The framework draws inspiration from human research methodology, incorporating iterative processes of planning, drafting, information searching, and revision. TTD-DR treats research report generation as a diffusion process, starting with a preliminary "noisy" draft that serves as an updatable skeleton to guide research direction, then iteratively refining through a "denoising" process powered by dynamic retrieval mechanisms and external information integration at each step.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to generate an initial research draft that serves as a structured foundation, so that I have a clear starting point and direction for comprehensive research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a research topic is provided THEN the system SHALL generate a preliminary "noisy" draft within 30 seconds
2. WHEN generating the initial draft THEN the system SHALL create a structured skeleton with clear sections and subsections
3. WHEN the initial draft is created THEN it SHALL serve as an updatable framework that guides subsequent research directions
4. IF the research topic is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL request clarification before proceeding with draft generation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to iteratively refine the research draft through dynamic information retrieval, so that the final report incorporates comprehensive and relevant external information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the denoising process begins THEN the system SHALL identify information gaps in the current draft
2. WHEN information gaps are identified THEN the system SHALL dynamically retrieve relevant external information
3. WHEN external information is retrieved THEN the system SHALL integrate it seamlessly into the existing draft structure
4. WHEN each iteration completes THEN the system SHALL evaluate the draft quality and determine if further refinement is needed
5. IF the maximum iteration limit is reached THEN the system SHALL finalize the current draft version

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want each component of the agent workflow to be enhanced through self-evolution algorithms, so that the system continuously improves its research capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the planning component executes THEN it SHALL apply self-evolution algorithms to optimize research strategy
2. WHEN questions are generated THEN the system SHALL use self-evolution to improve question quality and relevance
3. WHEN answers are processed THEN the system SHALL enhance answer accuracy through self-evolution mechanisms
4. WHEN report generation occurs THEN the system SHALL apply self-evolution to improve report structure and content quality
5. WHEN self-evolution processes complete THEN they SHALL generate high-quality context for the diffusion process

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to maintain research coherence throughout the iterative process, so that the final report maintains logical flow and consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN draft updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with the original research skeleton
2. WHEN new information is integrated THEN the system SHALL ensure it aligns with existing content themes
3. WHEN iterations progress THEN the system SHALL preserve the logical flow between sections
4. IF conflicting information is encountered THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts intelligently
5. WHEN the final report is generated THEN it SHALL demonstrate coherent argumentation throughout

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to provide transparency in its research process, so that I can understand and validate the research methodology and sources used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research begins THEN the system SHALL log all major decision points and reasoning
2. WHEN external sources are retrieved THEN the system SHALL maintain a comprehensive source bibliography
3. WHEN iterations occur THEN the system SHALL document what changes were made and why
4. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL provide a research methodology summary
5. IF requested by the user THEN the system SHALL explain any specific research decision or source selection

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to handle various research domains and complexity levels, so that it can adapt to different research needs and contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN different research domains are specified THEN the system SHALL adapt its methodology accordingly
2. WHEN complexity requirements vary THEN the system SHALL adjust iteration depth and detail level
3. WHEN domain-specific terminology is encountered THEN the system SHALL handle it appropriately
4. IF specialized research formats are required THEN the system SHALL accommodate different output structures
5. WHEN cross-disciplinary research is needed THEN the system SHALL integrate knowledge from multiple domains effectively
